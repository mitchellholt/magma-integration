abstract = {We propose a new algorithm, similar to Hermite's method for the integration of rational functions, for the resolution of Risch differential equations in closed form, or proving that they have no resolution. By requiring more of the presentation of our differential fields (in particular that the exponentials be weakly normalised), we can avoid the introduction of arbitrary constants which have to be solved for later. We also define a class of fields known as exponentially reduced, and show that solutions of Risch differential equations which arise from integrating in these fields satisfy the "natural" degree constraints in their main variables, and we-conjecture (after Risch and Norman) that this is true in all variables.},

abstract = {We present a new rational algorithm for solving Risch differential equations in towers oftranscendental elementary extensions. In contrast to a recent algorithm of Davenport we do not require a progressive reduction of the denominators involved, but use weak normality to obtain a formula for the denominator of a possible solution. Implementation timings show this approach to be faster than a Hermite-like reduction.},

@book{geddes:afca,
abstract = {Algorithms for Computer Algebra is the first comprehensive textbook to be published on the topic of computational symbolic mathematics. The book first develops the foundational material from modern algebra that is required for subsequent topics. It then presents a thorough development of modern computational algorithms for such problems as multivariate polynomial arithmetic and greatest common divisor calculations, factorization of multivariate polynomials, symbolic solution of linear and polynomial systems of equations, and analytic integration of elementary functions. Numerous examples are integrated into the text as an aid to understanding the mathematical development. The algorithms developed for each topic are presented in a Pascal-like computer language. An extensive set of exercises is presented at the end of each chapter. Algorithms for Computer Algebra is suitable for use as a textbook for a course on algebraic algorithms at the third-year, fourth-year, or graduate level. Although the mathematical development uses concepts from modern algebra, the book is self-contained in the sense that a one-term undergraduate course introducing students to rings and fields is the only prerequisite assumed. The book also serves well as a supplementary textbook for a traditional modern algebra course, by presenting concrete applications to motivate the understanding of the theory of rings and fields.},

abstract = {The elementary functions of a complex variable z are those functions built up from the rational functions of z by exponentiation, taking logarithms, and algebraic operations. The purpose of this paper is first to prove a "structure theorem" which shows that if an algebraic relation holds among a set of elementary functions, then they must satisfy an algebraic relation of a special kind. Then we make four applications of this theorem, obtaining both new and old results which are described here briefly (and imprecisely).^\ast(1) An algorithm is given for telling when two elementary expressions define the same function. (2) A characterization is derived of those differential equations having elementary solutions. (3) The four basic functions of elementary calculus-exp, log, tan, tan-1-are shown to be "irredundant." (4) A characterization is given of elementary functions possessing elementary inverses.},
