S,RationalIntegral,"Integrate the given rational function using Hermite's method and Rothstein-Trager. Return the integral and the arguments to every logarithm used (for naming purposes). This function assumes that: - Every rational function is always represented such that the numerator and denominator have GCD 1, and the denominator is monic.

S,IntegrateAssignNames,"Integrate the input, but allow reasonable default names to be assigned to all related structures, preserving existing user-defined names wherever possible. Return the integral. Optional parameters. integral: the already calculated integral. 0 is taken as a null value (if the input has integral 0, recomputing is assumed to have negligible cost). algebraic_number_name: the name to be assigned to the algebraic number (which may be) used to express the integral. If the constant field of the integral is the same as that of the input, then any existing names are used",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,DiffFieldElt,,DiffFieldElt,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
